# Ethical Considerations
GHARF has been developed to streamline Red Team exercises and defensive evaluations by leveraging CI/CD mechanisms (such as GitHub Actions). The development of this technology follows the ethical principles outlined below.

### 1. Responsible Disclosure
The method of using a self-hosted runner—the core of GHARF—as a C2 agent was disclosed to GitHub in advance and published with their permission. We handle any technical approaches that could potentially affect the platform’s design or operation in accordance with the principles of responsible disclosure.

### 2. Explicit User Consent
GHARF employs a strict default policy that requires explicit user approval before any process is executed in the workflow environment. This policy is designed to prevent unauthorized actions or unexpected operations from being performed without the user's intent.

### 3. Artifact Traceability
GHARF provides a mechanism for embedding known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) into artifacts (such as binary programs) generated by its workflows. In addition, it publishes [YARA rule](../misc/gharf.yara) to enable the detection of these artifacts, allowing third parties to appropriately identify and analyze outputs created by GHARF. This default setup is intended to make it possible to detect and trace the usage and impact of such artifacts after deployment.

### 4. Detection-Aware Design
GHARF is fully aware of the potential risk of misuse due to its ease of deployment and operation. Therefore, its pre-configured automated attack workflows are deliberately limited in sophistication to a level that can be easily detected by common endpoint security solutions such as antivirus (AV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems.

### 5. Intended Use and Scope
While GHARF is released as open-source software, it is primarily intended for use in security assessment, education, and research. In particular, it is designed for controlled environments, such as lab testing and training exercises. The developers explicitly do not endorse or permit the unauthorized use of GHARF on public networks or systems outside of your administrative control.

Users are expected to take full responsibility for operating the framework in legally and ethically appropriate contexts and environments.

### 6. Incident Response Readiness
In the event that GHARF is used for malicious purposes or a serious security risk is reported, appropriate actions may be taken, such as permanently or temporarily freezing the repository or modifying or removing affected features.

Contact methods for reporting such issues, as well as the type of information recommended when submitting a report, are described in the [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) within the GitHub repository. Please refer to that document for details.

### 7. Continuous Ethical Review
The design and publication policies of GHARF are subject to continuous review. Should new threat trends or technical risks emerge, the framework's policies and public documentation will be updated accordingly. These reviews are conducted both through regular internal evaluations and based on external feedback.
